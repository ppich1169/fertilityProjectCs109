        <h1> Why we decided to look into the US fertility rate?</h1>

                <h3>
                    Over the past fifty years, 
                    fertility rates in the US have plummeted and are currently at a 
                    historic low. Conversations about why fertility has fallen so 
                    substantially and how we can address the implications of this shift 
                    for government programs like social security have been quite salient 
                    in recent public discourse and in the 2024 election cycle. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Interestingly, there is significant variation in fertility 
                    rates across US states. We’d like to understand the relative 
                    importance of various factors in determining a state’s fertility rate.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    We plan to run a multiple regression of fertility rate 
                    (can get state-by-state here from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics) 
                    on a number of regressors
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We used our previous knowledge and assumptions to create a 15 dataset of predictors that we believe may influence fertility rates.
                    
                    Because fertility rate is evaluated statewide and states vary significantly in population size, we have decided that for all of the predictors, we are going to essentially normalize them by looking at the percentage of each state that fall into a specific category. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our features can be sorted into 5 main categories: <br> <br>
                    Time and Context, Cultural and Religious Factors, Demographic Factors, Socioeconomic Factors, & Political and Policy Factors
                </h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>
                    For the first visualization, I decided to create a bubble chart that shows the fertility rates for each state in the US for the year 2022. The size of the bubble represents the fertility rate, and the color represents the region of the US that the state is in.
                <br>
                <br>
                We wanted to give a broader understanding of the fertility rates in the US and how they vary across states. This visualization allows the user to see the fertility rates for each state at a glance and compare them to other states. The user can also hover over each bubble to see the exact fertility rate for that state.
                <br>
                <br>
                What struck me the most was how the fertility rates varied so much across states, with some states having much higher fertility rates than others, specifically between regions. If we examine the South and compare the general sizes of those states with the North-East, there's a stark contrast.

The map also includes a slider that allows the user to select a different year to view the fertility rates for that year.
