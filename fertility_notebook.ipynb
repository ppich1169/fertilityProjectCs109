    "One of our biggest considerations is that our predictor variables, X, is essentially 3d (reshaped), not 2d. We are looking at a bunch of predictors **over state** and **over time**. This might make our predictions complicated, especially because we are trying to see **why** fertility is changing over time (so the reason that there are less babies in 2022 can't simply be that it is 2022). Thus, it might make more sense to choose only **one year** to regress on. Also, it may be hard to **visualize** multiple years and states simultaniously as, for example, if we drew a map and colored each state by predictor category, we would have to choose one specific time to do so (and vice versa).
